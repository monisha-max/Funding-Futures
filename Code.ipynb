To be able to keep track of their daily steps students want to each have their pedometer. The SmartHealth Walking Fit Activity Tracker will be perfect for students to use during the school day to track how many steps they've taken, the distance they've gone, and what their heart rate is. Students will track their data in their science notebooks for the 8 weeks, which will be great practice in collecting and interpreting data! \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStudents thought that to go along with the Step it Up challenge access to great tasting filtered water and their own water tumblers would increase the amount of water students drink each day at school. The PUR water faucet filter will give students access to great tasting water. Many students don't bring their own water bottles to school and there is only one drinking fountain in our classroom.

I always want my students to feel that I can't wait to see them again. I deeply care about them and reflect daily on their needs.\\\\r\\\\n   My students are mostly English Language Learners and most of our students are on free or reduced lunch. Our students have various needs. I try to make my classroom a welcoming and warm place where they want to be. I love my students and only want the best for them. Like many teachers at our school, I constantly work hard in focusing what each student needs to get them to be on the next academic level.\\\\r\\\\n  I work with them small and whole groups to more properly address the areas that they maybe struggling with. All of this takes time and resources. Like many teachers, I try to purchase items that will help my students with their learning. \\\\r\\\\n  Our school recently became a STEAM school. Through science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics, our school wants to innovate our students to develop skills for the future.\",\n          \"My kindergarten students amaze me on a daily basis. EXCITEMENT and ENGAGEMENT while learning are my top goals as a kindergarten teacher. Keeping students excited about learning, and engaged in lessons starting in kindergarten, is key to a successful educational experience. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe 25 kindergarten students in my class attend an all day kindergarten session at CDSA.  \\\\r\\\\nCDSA is located in Boise, Idaho. This year we have expanded and are currently servicing 550 students grades K-6.  Our school is located in an urban Idaho district that services a diverse population of students. The students of my school come from a variety of economic backgrounds & situations, and are able to attend this public school of choice, for an opportunity to focus on the arts. \\\\r\\\\n\",\n          \"Students enjoy opening books and reading to each other. They get excited when they can connect the stories to information covered in our classroom, however, their choices are limited due to the small selection of non-fiction and fictional stories in our classroom library. Not only are they going to use these wonderful books in our classroom, but they will have the opportunity to read them at home. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI teach at a school where many of the students are not exposure to books selected for their reading levels at home.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI want to give my students an experience to find the joy and adventure in reading that I know can be achieved in our classroom!

Students thought that a great way to kick off our Keep it Fit theme would be to start a step count challenge. They came up with the idea of doing a 8 week Step it Up challenge that will restart throughout the year. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEach student will have a personalized daily/weekly step goal based on their average step count for one week prior to the start of the challenge. To be able to keep track of their daily steps students want to each have their pedometer. The SmartHealth Walking Fit Activity Tracker will be perfect for students to use during the school day to track how many steps they've taken, the distance they've gone, and what their heart rate is. Students will track their data in their science notebooks for the 8 weeks, which will be great practice in collecting and interpreting data! \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStudents thought that to go along with the Step it Up challenge access to great tasting filtered water and their own water tumblers would increase the amount of water students drink each day at school. The PUR water faucet filter will give students access to great tasting water. Many students don't bring their own water bottles to school and there is only one drinking fountain in our classroom. Each student will receive their own insulated water tumbler that they will keep at school.  Students want to make sure that everyone is hydrated and healthy!\",\n          \"My students are eager to read! Everyday we spend time in Guided Reading groups.

This seating arrangement in my classroom will not only provide comfort for students with all learning styles, but will also provide flexibility for me as a teacher to work with them in a setting where they are comfortable and engaged, along with us being able to physically utilize the classroom space for further learning, without being limited to seating arrangements and lack of movement of traditional classroom desks.\",\n          \"The new materials will add more options for learning to our small groups.

These groundbreaking systems encourage creative thinking and social interaction by expanding gameplay beyond the screen and making students get active.

First stop, the Kabul, Afghanistan of Khalid Hosseini's The Kite Runner. \\\\n\\\\nIt is so important to learn about and develop empathy for various cultures through our reading. However, our current book shelf needs a little diversification. Help us move beyond our small township liunes and see the world through the eyes of great international writers.\\\\n\\\\nYour generous donation will improve our classroom and ultimately, to the world that we all live in.

Students these days are inspired by technology and use it all day long. Incorporating technology into the classroom and learning environments gets their attention and helps them use the skills they already have. \\\\r\\\\nThe requested resources would be immensely helpful in the Theatre classroom and in after school play rehearsals. In my opinion, students learn best by doing. Using this laptop would allow my students to take charge of their learning, review performances, record sound effect,  and quickly take notes and write critiques. These necessary resources would allow us to efficiently document scenes and play performances and to log performance critiques and notes. These resources would allow me to teach my students the importance of responsibility. These valuable resources would also help us save time. There is never enough time in the day in a learning environment. This project is important because it allows my students to become more independent and to take charge of their learning.
